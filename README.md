## Fireball Project Overview

The Center for Near Earth Object Studies is NASA's center for computing asteroid, comet orbits, and their impact on Earth. The dataset used in this project comes from CNEOS is contains fireball sighting events provided by US Governement sensors. The dataset is not inclusive of all fireballs, only those detected by the sensors and reported by ground observers.

This project focused on gathering, cleaning, processing, and then presenting the data by findings trends or relationships in fireball sightings.

An interactive dashboard was created and is powered by a Python Flask application.
